# AST

This project is a poc for [TfMaker](https://github.com/no-code-terraform)

* the parser is using an ast 
* the emitter is used to create the final terraform directory
* the compiler as the main logic between the parser and the emitter

## Just launch main.py to create terraform.zip from data.json
